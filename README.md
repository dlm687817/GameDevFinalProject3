o	The game involves a mixture between Crossy Road and Run from coolmath4kids. I created an alien game that will allow the player to jump through asteroid platforms while avoiding obstacles along the way like satellites and meteors or falling from the platforms. The player can also collect spaceships to gain as many points as they can.  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e429b519-6e85-4bab-a6b9-94aa1b0683d6)
